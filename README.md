# SQL Business Analysis Project

In this project, we analyze data designed for business analysis which can be found in the Datasets of Kaggle under the name of [Business Analysis (junior)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sticktogethertm/business-analysis-junior) uploaded by Igor Panteleev. The data is divided into two sheets of a .xlsx file under the names 2019 and 2020. Both data sets have the variables:

- Order Number
- Client ID
- Product code
- Date of delivery
- Delivery amount

Using SQL we analyze these datasets and answer the following questions:

1) How many new clients are in 2020?
2) How much did the seller earn on new products in 2020?
3) List the products sold in 2019, the number of customers who ordered the products, and the total delivery amount
4) List the products sold in 2020, the number of customers who ordered the products, and the total delivery amount
5) What are the codes for the products that have been sold in both years and which ones are the most popular
6) Find the product with the biggest increase in 2020 compared to 2019
7) Check the seller's income by month. Is there seasonality?
8)
