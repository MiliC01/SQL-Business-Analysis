# SQL & Tableau Small Business Analysis Project

In this project, we clean and analyze data designed for business analysis which can be found in the Datasets of Kaggle under the name of [Business Analysis (junior)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sticktogethertm/business-analysis-junior) uploaded by Igor Panteleev. The data is divided into two sheets of a .xlsx file under the names 2019 and 2020. Both data sets have the variables:

- Order Number
- Client ID
- Product code
- Date of delivery
- Delivery amount

Additionally, the data contains null values and has to be cleaned.
