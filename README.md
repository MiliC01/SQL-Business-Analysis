# SQL & Tableau Small Business Data Analysis Project

In this project, we clean and analyze data designed for business analysis which can be found in the Datasets of Kaggle under the name of [Business Analysis (junior)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sticktogethertm/business-analysis-junior) uploaded by Igor Panteleev. The data is divided into two sheets of a .xlsx file under the names 2019 and 2020. Both data sets have the variables:

- Order Number
- Client ID
- Product code
- Date of delivery
- Delivery amount

The data contains null values and has to be cleaned. We create two documents in this repository called BAProj_Clean.sql and BAProj_Exp.sql where we document all the SQL queries where we clean and analyze the data. To visualize the data we will use Tableau.

# Data Cleaning

We start by downloading the data sets from Kaggle and uploading them to a new database called Business Analysis. We add the data sets by right-clicking the database type and under the [Tasks] tab select [import data...] 
![importing the data sets](https://github.com/MiliC01/SQL-Business-Analysis/blob/main/SQLBAProj/Screenshot%20(769).png?raw=true)
